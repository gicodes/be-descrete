# beDescrete.app

is a mini web application used to compose and share anonymous messages.

- This application utilises the *window.location* to redirect the browser.
- This application was built on HTML and vanilla Javascript.
- This application build is deployed to Vercel.

## Application Usability

This application is simple to use 

- Visit the web-link https://secret-msg-app-six.vercel.app
- Under the 'Enter a Secret Message' input your desired text and click create
- The application takes in your input and returns a harshed string in form of a web-link.
- The displayed web-link can be copied, shared && | opened in any web browser

## Application Scalability

This application is easily scalable in many ways.
Let's think about implementing on the present functionality.

- Web share: on the usability, 'it can shared' needs a share button and sharing options.
- Description: currently our 'Enter a secret message' does not clearly define the role | use.
- Create link: similar to the Description issue, the create button does not define it's role.
- App style: currently, our application lacks any basic styling. CSS will improve the UI.
